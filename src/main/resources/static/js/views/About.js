                <p>We are a collective dads, moms, weekenders, early risers, and international martial arts warriors.</p>
                <p>We recognize that not everyone is going to compete at a high-level in competitions, but we're here to help you reach your goals of becoming the best version of yourself in your discipline. Here at OpenMat, we're redefining the inner circle of gym-goers and martial artists of all disciplines. We know you're busy, so why be limited by the times your gym is open? With OpenMat, our vision is to connect you with gyms who have their doors open when you need them without having to worry about signing up for a new gym.</p>
                <p>We know that your discipline is often a way of life for most dedicated members such as yourself. That's why we've created our Corner forums to connect you with other OpenMat members. You can blog, vlog, comment, get advice on techniques, meet new sparing partners, and share content your interested in.</p>
